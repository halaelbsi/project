In my assignment, I created the code for the cycle of the day, starting from sunrise and ending at nighttime. The code starts off showing a beautiful sunrise that ends when you press 'a' and it turns to daytime! There is a flower on the grass that is going to get a friend later on. The sky turns to a light blue color and a cloud forms. By holding down on the mouse, it marks the midpoint of the day and it is sunnier and cloudier than before, and the flower changes color! By pressing 'b', you are moving on with your day and the sun is setting. The flower now has its friend. Finally, by pressing the right arrow, it turns to nighttime where the moon and stars light up the sky. I use an animation of a bird that changes along with the user interaction to allow for the user to enjoy the scenery. It changes speeds depending on the time of day. For instance, the bird flies much faster at night than it does during the day. I chose to create this for my project because I enjoy watching the sky during all times of the day and I love the peace that comes with it, and I hope you do too!
